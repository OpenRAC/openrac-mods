// Keyboard and mouse for Ratchet & Clank (README.md): the keys and the mouse, as the player bound
// them in the launcher, pressed into the first pad's report each tick, on top of a gamepad's. What
// a key presses follows where the game is (kbm::Context): in play the console's layout; in the
// title, the menus and the dialogs confirm and back; in a scene, a movie or the ship, a skip. In
// play the mouse turns the camera itself (kbm::DirectLook: the follow camera through its hook
// point, the first-person view before its update), and while the Quick Select is held open picks
// its slot by the way it moves; in the menus the cursor is free, points at the game's own
// menu items, clicks, and its wheel scrolls. Takes the keyboard from the port (its own WASD table
// stops) and the cursor while in play.
//
// The settings (openrac-mod.json), read once when the mod loads:
//   mouse_sensitivity       How far the camera turns for the mouse's motion.
//   mouse_acceleration      0 for none; more turns a fast flick further than a slow drag.
//   invert_y                Mouse up looks down (the game's own invert options never apply).
//   camera_tilt             Whether the follow camera keeps the tilt the mouse gave it (Stays) or
//                           levels out as the game does (Levels out).
//   capture_cursor          Hides the cursor and keeps it in the window while playing.
//   menu_mouse              In menus the cursor points at the game's items, a click confirms and
//                           the wheel scrolls.
//   walk_speed              How far the walk key pushes the left stick.
//   stick_ramp_ms           How long the movement keys take to push the stick all the way.
//   quick_select_dead_zone  How far, in pixels, the mouse moves before the Quick Select points at
//                           a slot.
//   one setting per action  The action's binds, up to two keys, mouse buttons or wheel directions
//                           (kbm::kActions lists them: move, walk, jump, fire, quick_select,
